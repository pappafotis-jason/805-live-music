## Overview
8:05 LIVE is an open-source, community-powered calendar and map for discovering live music events worldwide. Starting as a pilot in Panama City Beach, FL, it empowers musicians, venues, and fans to submit and find gigs effortlessly. Inspired by the frustration of fragmented listings and Sammy Hagar's "It's 8:05, it's time to rock," we're building a decentralized platformâ€”city by cityâ€”for the ultimate live music discovery tool.

- **Key Features**: Interactive Google Maps embeds, real-time updates via Channels, geospatial queries for "shows near me," and easy event submissions.
- **Philosophy**: Decentralized nodes per city, GPLv3-licensed, FOSS-aligned with clean, Pythonic aesthetics (e.g., Linux-like simplicity).
- **Parent Org**: RATlab Records (Rogue Artist Tribe)â€”decentralized music funding and community.
- **Domain**: [805LiveMusic.com](https://805livemusic.com) (coming soon).

If you're a dev who loves live music and open-source, this is your jam: Fix bugs, add integrations (e.g., Bandsintown), or moderate your local scene!

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Django Templates, Tailwind CSS, Google Maps Embed API, HTMX (for light interactivity), Alpine.js (optional).
- **Backend**: Python + Django, Django Channels (real-time).
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + PostGIS, Django ORM, Redis (caching/real-time).
- **Infra/DevOps**: GCP App Engine (hosting), GitHub Actions (CI/CD).
