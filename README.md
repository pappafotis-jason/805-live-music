## Overview
8:05 LIVE is an open-source, community-powered calendar and map for discovering live music events worldwide. Starting as a pilot in Panama City Beach, FL, it empowers musicians, venues, and fans to submit and find gigs effortlessly. Inspired by the frustration of fragmented listings and Sammy Hagar's "It's 8:05, it's time to rock," we're building a decentralized platformâ€”city by cityâ€”for the ultimate live music discovery tool.

- **Key Features**: Interactive Google Maps with custom pins, real-time updates via Socket.IO, geospatial queries for "shows near me," and easy event submissions.
- **Philosophy**: Decentralized nodes per city, GPLv3-licensed, FOSS-aligned with clean aesthetics (e.g., Material Design).
- **Parent Org**: RATlab Records (Rogue Artist Tribe)â€”decentralized music funding and community.
- **Domain**: [805LiveMusic.com](https://805livemusic.com).

If you're a dev who loves live music, this is your jam: Fix bugs, add integrations (e.g., Bandsintown), or moderate your local scene!

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Next.js, Tailwind CSS, @react-google-maps/api, React Hook Form, next-intl (i18n), Framer Motion (optional).
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express, Socket.IO, Auth.js.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + PostGIS, Prisma ORM, Redis (caching/real-time).
- **Infra/DevOps**: GCP (hosting), Vercel (frontend), GitHub Actions (CI/CD).
