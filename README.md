## Overview
8:05 LIVE is an open-source, community-powered calendar and map for discovering live music events worldwide. Starting as a pilot in Panama City Beach, FL, it empowers musicians, venues, and fans to submit and find gigs effortlessly. Inspired by the frustration of fragmented listings and Sammy Hagar's "It's 8:05, it's time to rock," we're building a decentralized platformâ€”city by cityâ€”for the ultimate live music discovery tool.

- **Key Features**: Interactive maps via Leaflet.js and OpenStreetMap, geospatial queries for "shows near me," and easy event submissions.
- **Philosophy**: Decentralized nodes per city, GPLv3-licensed, FOSS-aligned with clean, Pythonic aesthetics (e.g., Linux-like simplicity).
- **Parent Org**: RATlab Records (Rogue Artist Tribe)â€”decentralized music funding and community.
- **Domain**: [805LiveMusic.com](https://805livemusic.com) (coming soon).

If you're a dev who loves live music and open-source, this is your jam: Fix bugs, add integrations (e.g., Bandsintown), or moderate your local scene!

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Django Templates, Tailwind CSS, HTMX (for light interactivity), Leaflet.js + OpenStreetMap (interactive maps).
- **Backend**: Python + Django, Gunicorn (WSGI server).
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + PostGIS, Django ORM, Redis (caching).
- **Infra/DevOps**: Hostinger VPS (Ubuntu-based hosting), Nginx (web proxy), GitHub Actions (CI/CD).

Optional future: Django Channels (real-time), Celery (background jobs), Alpine.js (light client-side).

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension
- Redis
- Git
- Hostinger VPS (KVM 2 plan recommended)

### Steps
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/pappafotis-jason/805-live-music.git`
2. Install dependencies: `cd 805-live-music && python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up `.env` file: Add DB credentials, Redis URL, etc. (use `env.example` as template).
4. Database: Run `python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate`
5. Start dev server: `python manage.py runserver` (runs on http://localhost:8000)

For production: Deploy to Hostinger VPSâ€”SSH in, install stack (e.g., PostgreSQL, Redis, Nginx), set up Gunicorn/Nginx services, and point your domain.

## Usage
